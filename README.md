# Resume Screening System using NLP (Sentence Transformers)

An intelligent resume screening system that evaluates and ranks resumes against a job description using **semantic similarity** powered by **Sentence Transformers**.

This project simulates how modern Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) work in real-world hiring pipelines.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Recruiters often receive hundreds of resumes for a single job opening. Manual screening is time-consuming and inefficient.

This project:
- Uses **transformer-based embeddings** to understand semantic meaning
- Compares resumes with a job description
- Produces a **match score** indicating relevance

Unlike keyword-based systems, this approach captures **context and intent**.
